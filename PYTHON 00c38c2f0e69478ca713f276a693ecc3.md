# PYTHON

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

```html
print("Hello World!")
```

enumerate is useful for obtaining an indexed list

# Python Collections (Arrays)

There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

- **List** is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
- **[Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp)** is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
- **[Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp)** is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
- **[Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp)** is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

# List

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable

Lists are created using square brackets

The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.

Since lists are indexed, lists can have items with the same value

A list can contain different data types:

```html
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)
```

# Tuple

Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and **unchangeable**.

Tuples are written with round brackets

Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:

A tuple can contain different data types:

```html
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
```

# Set

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

A set is a collection which is *unordered*, *unchangeable**, and *unindexed*.

Sets are written with curly brackets

Sets cannot have two items with the same value.

```html
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)
```

# Dictionary

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:

Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and do not allow duplicates.

Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

```html
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)
```

# Python Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

- while loops
- for loops

# Python For Loops

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

```html
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
```

# The while Loop

With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

```html
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
```

# The break Statement

With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:

```html
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1
```

# The continue Statement

With the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next:

```html
i = 0
while i < 6:
  i += 1
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
```

# The else Statement

With the else statement we can run a block of code once when the condition no longer is true:

```html

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1
else:
  print("i is no longer less than 6")
```
