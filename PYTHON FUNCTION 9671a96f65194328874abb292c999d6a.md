# PYTHON FUNCTION

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

A function can return data as a result.

In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:

```html
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
```

# Calling a Function

To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:

```html
def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")

my_function()
```

# Arguments

Information can be passed into functions as arguments.

Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.

The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name:

```html
def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")
my_function("Linus")
```

# Number of Arguments

By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.

```html
def my_function(fname, lname):
  print(fname + " " + lname)
my_function("Emil", "Refsnes")
```

# Arbitrary Arguments, *args

If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a `*` before the parameter name in the function definition.

This way the function will receive a *tuple* of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:

```html
def my_function(*kids): 
 print("The youngest child is " + kids[2])
my_function("Emil", "Tobias", "Linus")
```

# Keyword Arguments

You can also send arguments with the *key* = *value* syntax.

This way the order of the arguments does not matter.

```html
def my_function(child3, child2, child1):
  print("The youngest child is " + child3)

my_function(child1 = "Emil", child2 = "Tobias", child3 = "Linus")
```

# Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs

If you do not know how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function, add two asterisk: `**` before the parameter name in the function definition.

This way the function will receive a *dictionary* of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:

```html
def my_function(**kid):
  print("His last name is " + kid["lname"])

my_function(fname = "Tobias", lname = "Refsnes")
```

# Default Parameter Value

The following example shows how to use a default parameter value.

If we call the function without argument, it uses the default value:

# Example

```html
def my_function(**country = "Norway"**): 

 print("I am from " + country)my_function("Sweden")

my_function("India")my_function()my_function("Brazil")
```

# Passing a List as an Argument

You can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it will be treated as the same data type inside the function.

E.g. if you send a List as an argument, it will still be a List when it reaches the function:

```html
def my_function(food):
  for x in food:
    print(x)

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

my_function(fruits)
```

# The pass Statement

`function` definitions cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have a `function` definition with no content, put in the `pass` statement to avoid getting an error.

```html
def myfunction():
  pass
```

# Positional-Only Arguments

You can specify that a function can have ONLY positional arguments, or ONLY keyword arguments.

To specify that a function can have only positional arguments, add `, /` after the arguments:

```html
def my_function(x, /):
  print(x)

my_function(3)
```

Without the `, /` you are actually allowed to use keyword arguments even if the function expects positional arguments:

```html
def my_function(x):
  print(x)

my_function(x = 3)
```

But when adding the `, /` you will get an error if you try to send a keyword argument:

```html
def my_function(x, /):
  print(x)

my_function(x = 3)
```

# Keyword-Only Arguments

To specify that a function can have only keyword arguments, add `*,` *before* the arguments:

```html
def my_function(*, x):
  print(x)

my_function(x = 3)
```

Without the `*,` you are allowed to use positionale arguments even if the function expects keyword arguments

```html
def my_function(x):
  print(x)

my_function(3)
```

But when adding the `*, /` you will get an error if you try to send a positional argument:

```html
def my_function(*, x):
  print(x)

my_function(3)
```

# Recursion

Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.

Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.

The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.

In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).

To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it.

```html
def tri_recursion(k):
  if(k > 0):
    result = k + tri_recursion(k - 1)
    print(result)
  else:
    result = 0
  return result

print("\n\nRecursion Example Results")
tri_recursion(6)                               
```
